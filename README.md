## pyconll

A simple package with simple intentions. Easily manipulate conll files using the familiar syntax of python.


## Motivation

When working with the Universal Dependencies project, I was dissapointed with the lack of good API options for maniuplating the conll files. There are plenty of good tools, none of which are general purpose enough. Grew is a great tool, but I found was slightly limiting for some tasks (and extremely productive for others). Treex is similar to grew in this regard. CL-CoNLLU is essentailly what I need, but it written in a language that many are not familiar with, Lisp. UDAPI might fit the bill, but it takes a while to go through the documentation and the package itself is quite large. More tools can be found on the Universal Dependencies page, but I found that all of them were lacking for my usage pattern. Namely, conll file manipulation in python in a simple, and intuitive way. This is my attempt at a small, intuitive package in a popular language that can be used in complex systems or small one off scripts.


## Uses

The usage of this package is to enable editing of CoNLL-U format annotations of sentences. For this reason, word forms for Tokens are not editable and Sentence Tokens cannot be reassigned. Right now, this package seeks to allow for straight forward editing of annotation in the CoNLL-U format. This does not include changing tokenization or creating completely new Sentences from scratch.


## Install

Installation is easy like with most python packages. Simply use `pip` to install from PyPi.

```
pip install pyconllu
```

This package is designed for, and only tested with python 3.4 and above.
