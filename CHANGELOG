Semantic Versioning.


[1.0] - 2018-xx-xx

Added

-   There is now a FormatError to help make debugging easier if the
    internal data of a Token is put into an invalid state. This error
    will be seen on running Token#conll.
-   Certain token fields with empty values, were not output when calling
    Token#conll and were instead ignored. This situation now causes
    a FormatError.

Fixed

-   DEPS parsing was broken before and assumed that there was less
    information than is actually possible in the UD format. This means
    that now deps is a tuple with cardinality 4.


[0.3.1] - 2018-08-08

Fixed

-   Fixed issue with submodules not being packaged in build


[0.3] - 2018-07-28

Added

-   Ability to easily load CoNLL files from a network path (url)
-   Some parsing validation. Before the error was not caught up front so
    the error could unexpectedly later show up.
-   Sentence slicing had an issue before if either the start or end
    was omittted.
-   More documentation and examples.
-   Conll is now a MutableSequence, so it handles methods beyond its
    implementation as well as defined by python.

Fixed

-   Some small bug fixes with parsing the token dicts.
