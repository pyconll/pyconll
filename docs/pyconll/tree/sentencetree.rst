sentencetree
===================================

A ``SentenceTree`` is a thin wrapper around a ``Sentence`` that also provides a tree based representation of the sentence. The sentence for a ``SentenceTree`` can be retreived through the ``sentence`` property and the tree through the ``tree`` property.

This wrapper is very bare currently and only seeks to create the tree based representation, and does not provide additional logic. Please create a github issue if you would like to see functionality added in this area!
