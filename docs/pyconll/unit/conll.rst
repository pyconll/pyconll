conll
===================================

A collection of CoNLL annotated sentences. This collection should rarely be created by API callers, that is what the ``pyconll.load`` module is for which allows for easy APIs to load CoNLL files from a string or file (no network yet). The Conll object can be thought of as a simple list of sentences. There is very little more of a wrapper around this.
