Welcome to the ``pyconll`` documentation homepage. Module documentation, changelogs, and guidance pages are listed above in the table of contents. Those unsure where to start can see the load_, conll_, sentence_, and token_ pages which contain documentation for the base CoNLL-U data types. There is also the `Getting Started`__ page which goes through an end-to-end example of using pyconll.

The github_ homepage has a limited set of examples, tests, and the source. Examples are currently limited. More examples are planned to for creation in June 2019.
