pyconll

A simple package with simple intentions. Easily manipulate conll files
using the familiar syntax of python.


Motivation

When working with the Universal Dependencies project, I was dissapointed
with the lack of good API options for maniuplating the conll files.
There are plenty of good tools, none of which are general purpose
enough. Grew is a great tool, but I found was slightly limiting for some
tasks (and extremely productive for others). Treex is similar to grew in
this regard. CL-CoNLLU is essentailly what I need, but it written in a
language that many are not familiar with, Lisp. UDAPI might fit the
bill, but it takes a while to go through the documentation and the
package itself is quite large. More tools can be found on the Universal
Dependencies page, but I found that all of them were lacking for my
usage pattern. Namely, conll file manipulation in python in a simple,
and intuitive way. This is my attempt at a small, intuitive package in a
popular language that can be used in complex systems or small one off
scripts.


Install

Installation is easy like with most python packages. Simply use pip to
install from PyPi.

    pip install pyconllu

This package is designed for, and only tested with python 3.4 and above.
